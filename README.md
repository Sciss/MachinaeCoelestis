## internal notes

For Indeterminus, a previous serialization version was used. This corresponds to Mellite v0.2.0; in order to generate 
the JSON condensation, the analysis must be run from branch `analysis_indet`. However, most plotting based on that 
output should be working from main `analysis` branch now.
